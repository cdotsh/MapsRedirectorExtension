# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Your privacy is important to me. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled while using the "Google Maps Redirector" Chrome extension. This policy applies solely to this extension and not to any other services or websites.

## Data Collection

This Chrome extension does not collect, store, or share any personal data, browsing data, or other user information.

## Permissions

The extension requires permission to access certain Google domains (e.g., google.com, google.de, etc.) to modify and redirect embedded map links for a better user experience. These permissions are strictly limited to the intended functionality of the extension and do not involve data collection or tracking.

## External APIs

This extension does not use or interact with any external APIs, services, or servers. All actions occur locally within your browser.

## Third-Party Content

The extension interacts with content on Google domains to identify embedded maps and enhance functionality. However, it does not transmit or process this content externally.

## Updates

I may update this Privacy Policy as necessary to reflect changes in the extensionâ€™s functionality or legal requirements. Any updates will be posted here, and the "Last Updated" date will be revised accordingly.

## Contact
